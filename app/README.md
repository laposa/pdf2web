# Simple Pdf2Web Viewer App

A simple flipbook viewer built in vanilla JavaScript without any dependencies offers an engaging way to showcase digital content, reminiscent of traditional paper flipbooks. By opting for vanilla JavaScript and CSS animations, this flipbook viewer remains highly maintainable and flexible. Developers can easily adjust or expand its features without the concerns of compatibility issues that often accompany third-party libraries.

## Initialisation

To initialize the viewer, you must provide the following parameters to the `pdf2web()` function.

- `target` (HTMLElement) – the target DOM element where the flipbook component will be initialized.
- `showTwoPages` (boolean) - indicates whether to display two pages side by side, provided that the viewport size allows it (see `mobileBreakpoint`).
- `showEditor` (boolean) - enables the editor, which allows users to populate the pages with hotspots. The editor does not work on mobile devices due to screen constraints.
- `mobileBreakpoint` (Number) - the point at which to display one page instead of two pages (used only if `showTwoPages` is `true`).
- `imageBaseUrl` (string) - image path prefix – can be used if images are referenced using relative path.
- `manifest` (object) - manifest generated by the editor app

```
    <div id="pdf2web-viewer"></div>
    <script src="/path/to/pdf2web-viewer.js"></script>
    <script>
      pdf2web({
          target: document.getElementById('pdf2web-viewer'),
          showTwoPages: true,
          showEditor: true,
          mobileBreakpoint: 480,
          saveHandler: function(manifest) { /* you saving code here */ },
          imagesBaseUrl: '/path/to/images/',
          manifest: {
            "pages": [
              {
                "hotspots": [
                    {
                        "height": 23.61,
                        "left": 35.07,
                        "title": "Walkers Chips",
                        "top": 13.66,
                        "url": "/walkers",
                        "width": 32.8
                    },
                    ...
                ],
                "filename": "page1.png",
                "order": 1
              },
              ...
            ]
          }
      });
    </script>
```

## Debugging

Use the following CSS style to display the page number on each slide:

```css
.pdf2web-page::before {
  content: attr(data-page);
  display: block;
  position: absolute;
  padding: 3px 10px;
  margin: 5px;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
```
